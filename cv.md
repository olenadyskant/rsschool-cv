### Summary
My main goal is to become a qualified Frontend-End Developer. Also, I truly would like to help people like me discovering, learning and improving their software development skills. I consider myself hardworking, very self-motivated and sociable person. I decided to dedicate my life to IT, as I consider this a useful and exciting activity.

I am currently studying JavaScript and strengthening all the gained knowledge by also learning Front End technologies (like AngularJS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS etc.)

Previously, I had a chance to be trained by experienced JS Developers in respective area for more than a year. Although, I remain working as a Service Desk Analyst at my current company, I could say that Iâ€™ve got a solid experience participating in resolving tasks for banking services here.

I am strongly targeting myself to grow as a professional, as a decent Frontend Developer.
